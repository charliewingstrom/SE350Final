# SE350Final
This was the final result of my object oriented software development class which I took in the fall of 2019. 
The goal of the program was to make a database and UI for a movie rental store. My professor provided code as a starting point as time went on, but he said what he did was 'ugly' and suggested we refactor which I did. 
During this project I learned a lot about handling a java project that has more than just a few files in it, and how I can refactor code to cut back on redundancy and allow for changes to be made more easily in the future.
